# INGAME

INGAME is a motion emulator with virtual reality features for playing first person
shooting/adventure games. Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that can be similar to
or completely different from the real world. INGAME has been designed to provide the user
with the feeling of being 'IN-the-GAME'. INGAME is modular in nature and consists of the
following modules.

1. HID module
1. Controller module
1. Pedometer module
1. VR headset

The first three modules listed above have been explained in detail later in the document. The
VR headset provides split stereo video to the user. The following image shows the functional
block diagram of the INGAME system
